# NanoCommons Data Management Plan

## Summary

This deliverable presents the initial data management plan (DMP) for the
starting community research infrastructure NanoCommons. It is a living
document that will be updated over the course of the project, with the
final plan to be delivered at the end of the project. We anticipate that
at least two other versions of the plan will be developed, to accommodate
the fast changing field of Open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable) data in Europe. The initial DMP covers a
significant part of the life cycle of research data, but cannot cover its
life after the end of this project. It covers the initial process of
thinking about how research data will be captured and handled during the
research, networking and transnational activities (JRA, NA and TA,
respectively), the follow up process of making it Open and FAIR, and
finally the long-term deposition of the data (and models and other outputs),
to ensure a life after the end of the NanoCommons project.  Note that there
are dedicated activities developing a sustainability plan for the complete
set of NanoCommons tools/services and approaches (i.e. the research
infrastructure itself, including the NanoCommons Data Warehouse (data
repository), which will ensure long term access under the FAIR principles
and will be made available to current and future nanosafety projects and
other stakeholders. The NanoCommons Data Warehouse may also be used as an
application for an Advanced Community, and application for establishment
of an European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), via Deliverable
report D10.3 “NanoCommons Sustainability Plan”. The NanoCommons data
management strategy follows the description-of-action (DoA), (Section
29.3, page 49) which prescribes access to all research data produced in
the project, including that produced with Users of the TA facilities.
Therefore, this deliverable will also describe suggestions for how the
project partners and TA users  can make data available in both Open and
FAIR formats.  Note that the NanoCommons DMP builds on DMP’s from related
projects such as OpenRIskNet and adapts it for other types of data, such
as that generated by Transnational Access (TA) Users.

## Introduction

The European Commission (EC) is running a flexible pilot under Horizon 2020
called the Open Research Data Pilot (ORD Pilot). The ORD pilot aims to improve
and maximise access to, and reuse of, research data generated by Horizon 2020
projects and ask projects to think about the totality of their data in all
forms, taking into account the need to provide open scientific information,
undertake commercialisation activities and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
management, address data privacy concerns and ensure data security, as well
as data management and preservation questions [[1](#user-content-ref1)]. Open data is data for which
everyone has the rights to access, reuse, repurpose, and redistribute. The ORD
Pilot aims to make the research data generated by selected Horizon 2020 projects
accessible with as few restrictions as possible, while at the same time
protecting sensitive data from inappropriate access [[2](#user-content-ref2)]. Projects starting from
January 2017 are by default part of the ORD Pilot, including the Research
infrastructures and e-Infrastructures, and as such are required to develop a
Data Management Plan (DMP).

To help optimise the potential for future sharing and reuse of data, the
NanoCommons DMP helps the project partners and Transnational Access (TA) Users
to consider any problems or challenges that may be encountered in making their
data Open and FAIR and helps them to identify ways to overcome these. This DMP
is a “living” document outlining how the research data collected or generated
will be handled during and after the NanoCommons project. It follows the
Guidelines on FAIR Data Management in Horizon 2020 [[3](#user-content-ref3)] and is based around the
realistic resources available to the project partners and TA Users taking the
current knowledge into account.  The ongoing activities to keep the DMP up to
date will follow an online, distributed approach as outlined in the Guidelines
for creating an online DMP [[4](#user-content-ref4)]. As part of our community building and sharing
of best practices approach, the NanoCommons initial DMP will be made publically
available to other nanosafety and nanoinformatics projects to reuse, and all
updates will be announced widely to the relevant communities (including
OpenRiskNet).
