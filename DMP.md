# NanoCommons Data Management Plan

## Summary


This deliverable presents the initial data management plan (DMP) for the
starting community research infrastructure NanoCommons (grant no 731032). It is a living
document that will be updated over the course of the project, with the
final plan to be delivered at the end of the project. We anticipate that
at least two other versions of the plan will be developed, to accommodate
the fast changing field of Open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable) data in Europe. The initial DMP covers a
significant part of the life cycle of research data, but cannot cover its
life after the end of this project. It covers the initial process of
thinking about how research data will be captured and handled during the
research, networking and transnational activities (JRA, NA and TA,
respectively), the follow up process of making it Open and FAIR, and
finally the long-term deposition of the data (and models and other outputs),
to ensure a life after the end of the NanoCommons project.  Note that there
are dedicated activities developing a sustainability plan for the complete
set of NanoCommons tools/services and approaches (i.e. the research
infrastructure itself, including the NanoCommons Data Warehouse (data
repository), which will ensure long term access under the FAIR principles
and will be made available to current and future nanosafety projects and
other stakeholders. The NanoCommons Data Warehouse may also be used as an
application for an Advanced Community, and application for establishment
of an European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), via Deliverable
report D10.3 “NanoCommons Sustainability Plan”. The NanoCommons data
management strategy follows the description-of-action (DoA), (Section
29.3, page 49) which prescribes access to all research data produced in
the project, including that produced with Users of the TA facilities.
Therefore, this deliverable will also describe suggestions for how the
project partners and TA users  can make data available in both Open and
FAIR formats.  Note that the NanoCommons DMP builds on DMP’s from related
projects such as OpenRIskNet and adapts it for other types of data, such
as that generated by Transnational Access (TA) Users.

## Introduction

The European Commission (EC) is running a flexible pilot under Horizon 2020
called the Open Research Data Pilot (ORD Pilot). The ORD pilot aims to improve
and maximise access to, and reuse of, research data generated by Horizon 2020
projects and ask projects to think about the totality of their data in all
forms, taking into account the need to provide open scientific information,
undertake commercialisation activities and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
management, address data privacy concerns and ensure data security, as well
as data management and preservation questions [[1](#user-content-ref1)]. Open data is data for which
everyone has the rights to access, reuse, repurpose, and redistribute. The ORD
Pilot aims to make the research data generated by selected Horizon 2020 projects
accessible with as few restrictions as possible, while at the same time
protecting sensitive data from inappropriate access [[2](#user-content-ref2)]. Projects starting from
January 2017 are by default part of the ORD Pilot, including the Research
infrastructures and e-Infrastructures, and as such are required to develop a
Data Management Plan (DMP).

To help optimise the potential for future sharing and reuse of data, the
NanoCommons DMP helps the project partners and Transnational Access (TA) Users
to consider any problems or challenges that may be encountered in making their
data Open and FAIR and helps them to identify ways to overcome these. This DMP
is a “living” document outlining how the research data collected or generated
will be handled during and after the NanoCommons project. It follows the
Guidelines on FAIR Data Management in Horizon 2020 [[3](#user-content-ref3)] and is based around the
realistic resources available to the project partners and TA Users taking the
current knowledge into account.  The ongoing activities to keep the DMP up to
date will follow an online, distributed approach as outlined in the Guidelines
for creating an online DMP [[4](#user-content-ref4)]. As part of our community building and sharing
of best practices approach, the NanoCommons initial DMP will be made publically
available to other nanosafety and nanoinformatics projects to reuse, and all
updates will be announced widely to the relevant communities (including
OpenRiskNet). 

### Data set description

This section refers to what kinds of data NanoCommons will collect and/or generate, and to whom these data might be useful later. The data set refers to: 
-	The data and metadata needed to validate results in scientific publications;  
-	The data and metadata needed to develop and validate the predictive in silico models for nanosafety, via the Joint Research Activities (JRA);  
-	Data and metadata generated by Users through TA activities; and,  
-	Other curated and/or raw data and metadata that may be required for validation purposes or with reuse value.  
Further, these questions are addressed in order to determine the potential reuse value of the data:  
-	What is the data about?  
-	Who created it and why?  
-	In which forms it is available?  
-	What (if any) standards were applied in generating the data?  
The metadata provided with the datasets answers such questions to enable data to be found and understood, ideally according to the particular standards applied. Finally the metadata, documentation and standards will help in making the data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) [REF,REF,REF].  

### Data sharing

According to the ORD Pilot programme, by default as much of the resulting data
as possible should be archived as Open Access. Therefore legitimate reasons for
not sharing resulting data should be explained in the DMP. However, data
protection or IPR agreements should not be compromised in any way, and data
sharing should be done responsibly. Therefore, the DMP describes any ethical or
legal issues that can have an impact on data sharing.

### Archiving and preservation

To ensure that publicly funded research outputs can have a positive impact on
future research, for policy development, and for societal change it is important
to assure the availability of data for a long period beyond the lifetime of the
project. However, this does not refer only to storage in a research data repository,
but also the need to consider the (re-)usability of the data. One of the main goals
of the research infrastructure being created by the NanoCommons project is to
harmonise nanosafety data and make it interoperable and sustainable, as a means
to facilitate in silico nanosafety assessment thereby reducing the need for 
costly and ethically questionable in vivo studies while supporting the route to 
market of nano-enabled products. Therefore, the project has a special obligation
to preserve both the software tools and any code produced to perform specific in
silico analyses and the data underpinning these models and tools. This will also 
require a high degree of clarity about any proprietary or open source tools that
will be needed to validate and use the preserved data. The general ethos of 
NanoCommons is that all datasets imported into the NanoCommons Knowledge Base 
using funds provided by NanoCommons will be made both Open and FAIR. The agreement 
with TA Users, previous projects who will provide datasets, and any other data 
sources utilised in the delivery of the NanoCommons research infrastructure will 
include specifications on the Open and FAIR provisions, as per Appendix A.

The structure of the NanoCommons DMP follows the Horizon 2020 ORD Pilot 
instructions on how to create a DMP. Therefore, additional to this document, 
the plan is stored and updated online using the recommended DMP tool 
(Figure 1) available at dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/ (see also Appendix B).

**The NanoCommons Research Data Management Plan**
The Data Management Plan (DMP) is essential to ensure the capture of 
return-on-investment (RoI) for the resources put in by the European Union,
via the EC’s H2020 research framework. An RDM strategy does not describe 
the data, but it describes the processes of the management of the data 
throughout its entire lifecycle.  The NanoCommons ethos is that Data 
should be both FAIR and Open, and all our activities will expressly 
utilising formats that support this. NanoCommons will build on the lessons 
and experience from the NanoREG project, which utilised a General Assembly 
meeting to decide on an open licence for specific outputs if the 
Consortium Agreement did not specify the reuse conditions explicitly. 

Before we continue, we should define to what kind of data this DMP 
applies. Section 1.3 provides more detail of the types of data to be 
imported into or generated within NanoCommons, but the starting point
is basically any data produced in the NanoCommons project, which
includes, but is not limited to, experimentally measured data and
computed data via modelling or statistics, including that produced 
by TA Users as part of their access provision.

## Data summary

### Purpose of the data collection/generation

The data collected/generated within the NanoCommons Project aims to
provide a harmonised and streamlined workflow covering all aspects 
of the data lifecycle, which includes experimental planning, data 
acquisition, manipulation and analysis, data storage and Open and 
FAIR access when possible (for further information please refer to 
Appendix B). The collected/generated data will be used to meet the 
project’s objectives in developing and openly providing the in silico 
nanosafety modelling and nanoinformatics tools needed by the 
nanosafety scientific community for the production of high quality,
harmonised and sustainable data. To achieve these objectives the 
NanoCommons project aims to implement appropriate standardised 
experimental procedures and data curation techniques, to promote 
ontology harmonisation and produce datasets aligned with the highest
standards of scientific quality within the project.

Thus, the data collected/generated within NanoCommons will be available 
in the correct format and readily available to be implemented and used 
for analysis via the tools developed within the project. At the same 
time, data harmonisation will allow data interoperability and the 
combination of different datasets (from a range of sources, as long as 
the conditions for data sharing are compatible with the needs of NanoCommons
- see Appendix A for details), where applicable and following agreement of 
the respective owners, that will allow more complex analyses to be performed 
and can also promote cross-project/field cooperation and translational 
research.

The NanoCommons RDM Copyright, License, and Waiver (CLW) Clearance Form will be used
in cases where data needs to be transferred, stored and analysed through the 
NanoCommons infrastructure via the project’s TA’s. In such cases NanoCommons will 
establish a minimum set of requirements for the data to be applicable to be included 
to the infrastructure, which are based on the FAIR data principles.

If a CC license is or was used, then it suffices to list the name of the license. In 
that case, the answer to the second and third question may, in fact, be the same. In 
any other case, data providers will have to agree to the NanoCommons terms and 
conditions regarding the optimum use of data and licensing. Such actions may include 
a local instance of part or the entire dataset to be used/analysed to be stored in 
NanoCommons servers, so that it can facilitate experimental workflows and is readily 
available for use by the NanoCommons experts. At the same time, it would be desirable 
for any raw data and metadata produced/generated to be made available in accordance 
with FAIR principles and accessible through the NanoCommons tiered licensing system. 
If that is not possible for raw data (e.g. pending publications), then a descriptive 
sub-data set and the metadata should be made available under the FAIR principles. 
Finally, the NanoCommons consortium should attempt to make all fully user exploited 
raw data and metadata publicly accessible to promote data interoperability and 
translational research. In such cases, the NanoCommons consortium will make sure that 
any use of data and metadata will be properly used and cited by external users, 
through the appropriate actions (e.g. DOI assignment) and terms and conditions.  

## Appendix B: NanoCommons Customized RDM Online Plan

The NanoCommons customised RDMO Plan will cover the entirety of the data lifecycle
(Figure A1), which contains 6 steps, i.e. experimental planning, data acquisition,
data manipulation, data analysis, data storage and online access using Open data and 
FAIR principles whenever possible. Each step of the data lifecycle aims to provide
the NanoCommons partners, TA Users and the wider nanosafety and nanoinformatics
communities with all the necessary tools for the production, analysis and handling
of high quality data.

Figure A1. The complete data lifecycle.

## Step 1: Experimental planning

The first step of the data lifecycle is the experimental planning, during which 
the identification of research endpoints takes place, the number of samples and
time points, and the necessary workflow and experimental assays and/or modelling
tools are identified. During this step the whole experimental workflow is
designed, the detailed experimental and/or analytical protocols identified, what
is recorded and in what detail, and the appropriate data curation templates
created. This process will take place irrespective of the nature of the needed
work (experimental and/or theoretical), as it will customise the workflow to
the specific needs of individual Users.

The specified workflow will be implemented into the SciNote online lab-book
(Figure A2, scinote.net), which will include all the separate steps of the
experimental and/or theoretical workflow. SciNote was the prefered online
lab-book due to a combination of user friendliness, dynamic and versatile
nature and significant capabilities, although other options are also commercially 
available. SciNote offers the capability of implementation of a desired data
master curation template for experimental data to be stored and extracted,
while providing also the opportunity for distinct smaller scale templates,
which can be protocol specific. It also offers the capability of analytical
protocols implementation, metadata creation and reporting. It also allows
the design and assignment of experimental workflows at various levels ranging
from an individual researcher to a consortium wide scale, while being readily
available both through local (LAN) and wide (WAN) networks based on specific 
needs.

Each workflow step will be linked to the necessary experimental and/or 
computational detailed protocols (Figure A3), the results page (Figure A4)
and the master data curation template (Figure A5), which will be possible 
to automatically extract and upload to the desired data repository. The
complete experimental or computational stepwise workflow will be accessible 
by the TA Users and the NanoCommons partners that will be responsible for
the successful completion of the specific task, and will allow the 
streamlined online transfer of data between partners facilitating the
prompt completion of the entire workflow.

Figure A5. The complete set of acquired/computed data will be automatically
transferred to a curation template, which will be possible to automatically
extract and send for uploading to the NanoCommons and any other linked data
repository.

## Step 2: Data acquisition and data curation

During the second step the actual data acquisition and simultaneous curation
takes place along with data digitisation using either directly online
lab-books described above or through the offline acquisition/analysis and
subsequent transfer to the online lab-books and the specific data curation
template.

## Step 3: Data manipulation and data curation

The third step of the DMP will focus on data manipulation, i.e. the process
of data cleansing and control of the dataset’s quality and completeness.
During this stage the dataset completeness will be evaluated, potential
gaps and/or outliers identified and any repetition or supplemental data 
acquisition needed will take place. When the dataset is completed it will
be stored into a data repository, compatible with EUON, and any tools
needed for the subsequent analysis will be implemented and linked to it.
The tools developed and on offer from the NanoCommons Project are based
on an ongoing survey ([http://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/PK2KXWW](http://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/PK2KXWW))
regarding the needs and desires of the NanoSafety Community, and beyond. 

## Step 4: Data analysis

This step consists of all potential analytical or computational work 
that needs to take place to the produced dataset, in order to extract
meaningful data interpretation and research outputs. The analysis will
be based on the needed tools provided via the NanoCommons platform
(e.g. QSARs, Omics, modelling, visualisation) and will be fully
integrated with the NanoCommons ontology (with any missing terms or
concepts added in draft form in real time, which will then be checked,
amended and integrated into the final ontology once it is confirmed
by partner MU that there is no equivalent term already in place), and
will be implemented based on individual needs, within the NanoCommons
KnolwedgeBase platform, leading to peer-reviewed open access
publication(s).

## Step 5: Data Storage

Following the completion of the analytical or computational procedure,
the produced data will be backed up and stored and the necessary
metadata will be created. The metadata will be used to inform potential
future users regarding the ownership of the datasets and user rights,
information on retrieval and analytical descriptions of the respective
datasets. During this step any necessary documentation describing the
above will also be created and DOI numbers will be assigned to each
dataset. DOIs will be used to assist with publications (submitting raw
datasets to peer-reviewed journals in a digital form), referencing of
the respective datasets by future users, to ensure that the original
data owners are acknowledged and to facilitate the transition from
closed to FAIR and Open data.

## Step 6: FAIR Data

The final step in the NanoCommons online data management processes
will be the transformation of the data collected/generated/analysed
through the project as FAIR and Open. NanoCommons is dedicated to
FAIR data, but also acknowledges the need for the protection of the
original data owners until all desired data exploitation and 
publications have been completed. In that sense, the NanoCommons 
Consortium will be in close contact with TA Users and project
partners and will try to ensure that all data will eventually
become FAIR and, when possible, Open. As noted in Appendix A, a
prerequisite for securing of TA funding and technical support via
NanoCommons is agreement that data imported and generated as a
result of JRA, NA and TA activities will be made Open and FAIR.
For that, copyright and IP owners must be clearly defined.
